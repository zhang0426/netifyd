Description: Netify Agent
 The Netify (https://www.netify.ai/) Agent is a deep-packet inspection server.  The Agent is built on top of nDPI (http://www.ntop.org/products/deep-packet-inspection/ndpi/) (formerly OpenDPI) to detect network protocols and applications.  These detections can be saved locally, served over a UNIX or TCP socket, and/or "pushed" (via HTTP POSTs) to a remote third-party server.  Flow metadata, network statistics, and detection classifications are stored using JSON encoding.
 Optionally, the Netify Agent can be coupled with a Netify Cloud (https://www.netify.ai/) subscription for further cloud processing, historical storage, machine-learning analysis, event notifications, device detection/identification, along with the option (on supported platforms) to take an active role in policing/bandwidth-shaping specific network protocols and applications.
